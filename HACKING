Couple of random remarks about how Puzz-le works ...
----------------------------------------------------

puzzlewindow.cpp is a main widget class which is responsible for handling
all user generated events ( some of which get passed to another classes.)
Depending on user action addition widgets ( aboutdialog.cpp, filedialog.cpp) are displayed on top of the main widget.

gamedialog.cpp and optionsdialog.cpp are the only real dialogs (derived from QDialog).

playground.cpp is a class responsible for handling game logic, game display.
It's main game loop is being called from puzzlewindow.cpp which has at regular intervals
(synch provided by QTimer.)

Shortcomings
------------
There is definately too much code for in the playground.cpp class. This stuff could easily be optimized as far as code size is concerned.  There is a still problem with DEMO games not going into to sleep when focus is switched to another application.
